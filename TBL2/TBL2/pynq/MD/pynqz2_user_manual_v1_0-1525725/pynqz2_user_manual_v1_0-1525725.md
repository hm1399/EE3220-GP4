# <span id="page-5-0"></span>2 Board files and XDC constraints file

Board files containing the Zynq PS configuration for the PYNQ-Z2 can be downloaded from the TUL website:

<http://www.tul.com.tw/download/pynq-z2.zip>

The board files can be used with Vivado to automatically configure the PS when creating new Zynq designs for the board.

A master XDC constraints file which contains pin constraints for the PYNQ-Z2 is also available from the TUL website:

[http://www.tul.com.tw/download/pynq-z2\\_v1.0.xdc.zip](http://www.tul.com.tw/download/pynq-z2_v1.0.xdc.zip)

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>3 Power

The PYNQ-Z2 can be powered from the Micro-USB port (J8), an external power supply, or a battery. The power source is selected by setting jumper J9 (near SW1) to USB or REG (External power REGulator/Battery).

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

The MicroUSB port connects to a standard USB port and should provide enough power for most designs. More demanding applications may require more power than the USB port can provide.

When more power is required, an external power regulator (coax, center-positive 2.1mm internal-diameter plug) can be connected to the power jack (DC1). The board supports 7VDC to 15VDC (12V recommended). Suitable supplies can be purchased from the TUL website.

A battery can also be used to power the PYNQ-Z2 by attaching the positive terminal to the "VIN" pin on the Arduino J7 connector (with jumper J9 set to REG). The negative terminal can be connected to one of the pins labeled GND on J7.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>4 Boot mode selection

The PYNQ-Z2 supports MicroSD, Quad SPI Flash, and JTAG boot modes. The boot mode is selected using the Mode jumper (JP1). TO select the boot mode, move the jumper to the appropriate position as indicated by the label on the board.

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>5 Clock Sources

The PYNQ-Z2 provides a 50 MHz clock to the Zynq PS\_CLK input, which is used to generate the clocks for each of the PS subsystems. The 50 MHz input allows the processor to operate at a maximum frequency of 650 MHz.

The PYNQ-Z2 also has an external 125 MHz reference clock connected to pin H16 of the PL. The external reference clock allows the PL to be used independently of the PS.

Figure 6.1 outlines the clocking scheme used on the PYNQ-Z2. Note that the reference clock output from the Ethernet PHY is used as the 125 MHz reference clock to the PL. When the PHYRSTB signal is driven low, the Ethernet PHY (U5) is held in reset disabling the CLK125.

For a full description of the capabilities of the Zynq PL clocking resources, refer to the "7 Series FPGAs Clocking Resources User Guide" available from Xilinx.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>6 DRAM

The PYNQ-Z2 includes a Micron 256Mx16 DDR3 memory (MT41K512M16HA-125:A) creating a single rank, 16-bit wide interface with a total capacity of 512MB. The DDR3 is connected to the hard memory controller in the Processor Subsystem (PS).

The PS incorporates an AXI memory port interface, a DDR controller, the associated PHY, and a dedicated I/O bank. DDR3 memory interface supports speeds of up to 525 MHz/1050 Mbps on the PYNQ-Z2 board.

For best DDR3 performance, DRAM training is enabled for write leveling, read gate, and read data eye options in the PS Configuration Tool in the Xilinx tools. Training is done dynamically by the controller to account for board delays, process variations and thermal drift.

The PYNQ-Z2 board files (see section 2) contain the configuration for the DRAM controller which includes optimum starting values for the training process taking into account PCB and trace delays (propagation delays) for the memory signals board delays are specified for each of the byte groups. These parameters are board-specific and were calculated from the PCB trace length reports. The DQS to CLK Delay and Board Delay values are calculated specific to the PYNQ-Z2 memory interface PCB design.

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>7 Quad SPI Flash

The PYNQ-Z2 features a Spansion S25FL128S Quad SPI serial NOR flash.

- 16 MB
- x1, x2, and x4 support
- Bus speeds up to 104 MHz, supporting Zynq configuration rates @ 100 MHz In Quad SPI mode, this translates to 400Mbs
- Powered from 3.3V

The Multi-I/O SPI Flash memory can be used to initialize and boot the PS subsystem as well as configure the PL subsystem, or as non-volatile code and data storage.

The SPI Flash connects to the Zynq-7000 SoC and supports the Quad SPI interface. This requires connection to MIO[1:6,8] as outlined in the Zynq datasheet.

*Table 1 SPI Flash MIO pin mapping*

Quad-SPI feedback mode is used, thus qspi\_sclk\_fb\_out/MIO[8] is left to freely toggle and is connected only to a 20K pull-up resistor to 3.3V. This allows a Quad SPI clock frequency greater than FQSPICLK2

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>8 USB Host

The PYNQ-Z2 includes a TI TUSB1210 USB 2.0 PHY with an 8-bit ULPI interface connected to the Zynq PS USB 0 controller (MIO[28-39]). The PHY features a HS-USB Physical Front-End supporting speeds of up to 480Mbs. The USB interface is configured to act as an embedded host. USB OTG and USB device modes are not supported.

One of the Zynq PS USB controllers can be connected to the appropriate MIO pins to control the USB port.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>10 MicroSD

The PYNQ-Z2 has a MicroSD slot (SD1). An SD card can be used to boot the board, or for applications that require non-volatile external memory storage. The PS IOP controller SDIO 0 is wired to this port via MIO[40-47]. The pinout can be seen in Table 7.1. The peripheral controller supports SDIO host mode with 1-bit and 4-bit SD transfer modes. SPI mode is not supported.

The Zynq PS UART control can be connected to the appropriate MIO pins to control the MicroSD port.

| MIO Pin | Name |
|---------|------|
| 40      | CCLK |
| 41      | CMD  |
| 42      | D0   |
| 43      | D1   |
| 44      | D2   |
| 45      | D3   |
| 47      | CD   |

*Table 3 SD MIO pin mapping*

The maximum clock frequency is 50 MHz which supports both low-speed and highspeed cards. A Class 4 MicroSD card or better is recommended.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>11 Ethernet PHY

The PYNQ-Z2 has a Realtek RTL8211E-VL PHY supporting 10/100/1000 Ethernet. The PHY is connected to the Zynq RGMII controller. The auxiliary interrupt (INTB) and reset (PHYRSTB) signals connect to MIO pins MIO10 and MIO9, respectively.

One of the Zynq PS Ethernet controllers can be connected to the appropriate MIO pins to control the Ethernet port.

| MIO Pin | Name                 | MIO Pin     | Name |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|------|
| 9       | Ethernet Reset       | 25          | RXD2 |

| 24      | RXD1                 |             |      |

*Table 4 Ethernet MIO pin mapping*

The Zynq does not need to be configured for the PHY to establish a connection. After power-up the PHY starts with Auto Negotiation enabled, advertising 10/100/1000 link speeds and full duplex. The PHY will automatically establishes a link if there is an Ethernet-capable partner connected.

There are two status LEDs on the RJ-45 connector that indicate traffic activity and link status. Table 9.1 shows the default behavior.

| LED            | Color  | Description                                    |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Link LED       | Green  | <br>Blinking: Transmitting or Receiving       |
| (Right)        |        |                                                |
| Act LED (Left) | Yellow | <br>Blinking: There is activity on this port. |
|                |        | <br>Off: No link is established.              |

*Table 5 Ethernet status LEDs*

Although the default power-up configuration of the PHY might be enough in most applications, the MDIO bus is available to manage the interface. The RTL8211E-VL is assigned the 5-bit address 00001 on the MDIO bus. With simple register read and write commands, status information can be read out and the configuration can be changed. The Realtek PHY follows an industry-standard register map for basic configuration.

The PHY is clocked from the same 50 MHz oscillator that clocks the Zynq PS.

#### **MAC address**

A one-time-programmable (OTP) region of the Quad-SPI flash has been factory programmed with a 48-bit globally unique EUI-48/64™ compatible identifier. The OTP address range [0x20;0x25] contains the identifier with the first byte in transmission byte order being at the lowest address. Refer to the [Flash memory](http://www.cypress.com/file/177966/download)  [datasheet](http://www.cypress.com/file/177966/download) for information on how to access the OTP regions. When using the PYNQ framework, Ethernet is automatically handled in the boot-loader, and the Linux system is automatically configured to use this unique MAC address.

# <span id="page-16-0"></span>12 MicroUSB Port

The PYNQ-Z2 includes an FTDI FT2232HL USB-UART bridge (attached to connector J8 PROG UART) that supports USB-JTAG, USB-UART. The PYNQ-Z2 can also be powered from the MicroUSB port. The USB\_UART allows PC applications to communicate with the board using standard COM port commands (or the tty interface in Linux and MacOS). The Zynq PS UART 0 controller is used to connect to the UART device.

One of the Zynq PS UART controllers can be connected to the appropriate MIO pins to control the UART port.

| MIO Pin | Name       |
|---------|------------|
| 14      | UART Input |
| 15      | UART       |
|         | Output     |

*Table 6 UART MIO pin mapping*

#### **Driver**

The driver for the USB\_UART should be automatically installed when the board is connected to a computer using Windows 7 or later operating system, and recent versions of Linux and MacOS.

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>13 HDMI ports

The PYNQ-Z2 contains two unbuffered HDMI ports connected directly to the PL. The board labels indicate one HDMI port as input and the other port as output, but as both ports are connected to PL pins, the designer can choose to use each of these ports as input or output. Both ports use HDMI type-A receptacles with the data and clock signals terminated and connected directly to the Zynq PL.

The 19-pin HDMI connectors include three differential data channels, one differential clock channel five GND connections, a one-wire Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) bus, a two-wire Display Data Channel (DDC) bus, a Hot Plug Detect (HPD) signal, a 5V signal capable of delivering up to 50mA, and one reserved (RES) pin. All non-power signals are connected to the Zynq PL with the exception of RES.

*Table 8 HDMI I2C MIO pin mapping*

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>14 LEDs, Buttons, Switches

The PYNQ-Z2 board includes 2 tri-color LEDs, 2 dipswitches, 4 push buttons, and 4 individual LEDs connected to the PL.

![](_page_19_Picture_2.jpeg)

#### **Push-buttons**

The four push buttons generate a logic high on the corresponding PL pin when pressed.

| Signal Name | PL PIN |
|-------------|--------|
| BTN0        | D19    |
| BTN1        | D20    |
| BTN2        | L20    |
| BTN3        | L19    |

*Table 9 Push Button PL pin mapping*

### **Switches**

When the switches are closed (in the "up" position) they generate a logic high on the corresponding PL pins.

| Signal Name | PL PIN |
|-------------|--------|
| SW0         | M20    |
| SW1         | M19    |

*Table 10 Dip switch PL pin mapping*

#### **LEDs**

The four individual LEDs are anode-connected to the Zynq PL via 330-ohm resistors. Applying logic high to the appropriate pins will turn on the LEDs.

| Signal Name | PL PIN |
|-------------|--------|
| LED0        | R14    |
| LED1        | P14    |
| LED2        | N16    |
| LED3        | M14    |

*Table 11 LED PL pin mapping*

The board also includes LEDs indicating board power, PL programming "done", and status for USB and Ethernet.

#### **Tri color LEDs**

Each of the 2 tri-color LEDs consists of three internal Reg, Blue Green LEDs. The input signals to the internal RGB LEDs are driven by the Zynq PL through a transistor, which inverts the signals.

| Signal Name | PL PIN |
|-------------|--------|
| LD4 Blue    | L15    |
| LD4 Red     | N15    |
| LD4 Green   | G17    |
| LD5 Blue    | G14    |
| LD5 Red     | M15    |
| LD5 Green   | L14    |

*Table 12 LED PL pin mapping*

The tri-color LEDs are high intensity. It is recommended to use pulse-width modulation (PWM) when driving the tri-color LEDs nd to aid driving the tri-color LEDs with more than a 50% duty cycle. Using PWM also allows the LED to support a wide range of colors by adjusting the duty cycle of each color.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>15 Board reset signals

SRST is the external system reset. It resets the Zynq device without disturbing the debug environment. System reset erases all memory content within the PS, including the OCM. The PL is also cleared during a system reset. System reset does not cause the boot mode strapping pins to be re-sampled.

The SRST button also causes the CK\_RST signal to toggle in order to trigger a reset on any attached shields.

The Zynq PS supports external power-on reset, a master reset of the whole chip. The TPS65400 power regulator drives a PGOOD signal to hold the system in reset until all power supplies are valid.

The PROG push switch, labeled PROG, enables Zynq PROG\_B. This resets the PL and causes DONE to be de-asserted. The PL will remain unconfigured until it is reprogrammed by the processor or via JTAG.

# <span id="page-22-0"></span>16 Pmod Ports

There are 2 Pmod ports on the PYNQ-Z2, labelled A and B.

# <span id="page-24-0"></span>17 Arduino Shield Connector

The Arduino shield connector has 26 pins connected to the Zynq PL. The pins can be used as GPIO. Compatible Arduino shields can be connected to the PYNQ-Z2 board via this header to extended functionality. Note that as the Arduino header is connected to the PL, a design with appropriate controllers must be loaded before the Arduino header can be used. Six of the Arduino pins (labeled A0-A5) can also be used as single-ended analog inputs with an input range of 0V-3.3V, and another six (labeled AR0-AR13) can be used as differential analog inputs.

**Note: The PYNQ-Z2 is not compatible with shields that output 5V digital or analog signals. Driving pins on the PYNQ-Z2 shield connector above 5V may cause damage to the Zynq.**

### **Digital I/O**

The pins connected directly to the Zynq PL can be used as general-purpose inputs/outputs. These pins include the pins labelled I2C (SCL, SDA), SPI (SS, SCL, MISO, MOSI), and general purpose I/O pins. There are 200 Ohm series resistors between the FPGA and the digital I/O pins to help provide protection against accidental short circuits. The absolute maximum and recommended operating voltages for these pins are outlined in the table below.

|           | Absolute | Recommended       | Recommended       | Absolute        |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
|           | Minimum  | Minimum Operating | Maximum Operating | Maximum Voltage |
|           | Voltage  | Voltage           | Voltage           |                 |
| Powered   | -0.4V    | -0.2V             | 3.4V              | 3.75V           |

*Figure 1 Single-Ended Analog Inputs*

This circuit allows the XADC module to accurately measure any voltage between 0V and 3.3V (relative to the PYNQ-Z2's GND) that is applied to any of these pins.

If you wish to use the pins labeled A0-A5 as Digital inputs or outputs, they are also connected directly to the Zynq PL before the resistor divider circuit.

The pins labeled V\_P and V\_N are connected to the VP\_0 and VN\_0 dedicated analog inputs of the FPGA. This pair of pins can also be used as a differential analog input with voltage between 0-1V, but they cannot be used as Digital I/O.
